  This is continued from the outcome of assignment 1 and I have done the requirements in this assignment.
  And I dug a little deeper with some experiments and found that, in a metaphor, this netlifycms is a wheel when Wordpress is a rocket. 
  However, I think that could be a right one for developers who are looking for a wheel or wheels-like-cms with particular potentials.
